# DevDataProd_assignment3
Files for assignment 3 of Developing Data Products on Coursera. 

The assignment is to develop a shiny app and pitch presentation in R Presenter to accompany it. I've decided to create an app that creates UV-Vis spectra for given input values of number of pKa values and set.seed value for reproducibility. The app outputs the plot of spectra and the table of pKa values.
